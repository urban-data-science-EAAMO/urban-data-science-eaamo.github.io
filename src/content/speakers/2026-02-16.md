talkTitle: "Equity in urban transportation: Gendered travel differences in Canada"
abstract: |
  There is a growing conversation in academic circles, media, and decision-making spaces about the need to achieve gender equity in many aspects of society, including transportation. In urban transportation, public transport safety concerns disproportionately affect women, while transportation systems for all modes (transit, bike, pedestrian) are still not implementing policies and solutions that sufficiently adapt to women’s needs. One challenge to designing effective policies is a general lack of disaggregated, reliable, and up-to-date information about women’s travel patterns. This talk will focus on new avenues to explore differences in travel patterns between men and women and how these results could translate into urban policy, using Canadian cities as case studies.
