talkTitle: "Targeted urban afforestation can substantially reduce income-based heat disparities in U.S. cities"
abstract: |
  Previous studies on urban heat mitigation, critical for urban planning and public health, have generally focused on a handful of cities, ignored logistical constraints, or insufficiently resolved urban-scale processes. Here, we fuse satellite-derived estimates of urban heat and multiple physical properties to develop a non-parametric machine learning approach to capture non-linearities in thermal anomalies (ΔAT) across 493 U.S. cities. This enables computationally-efficient data-driven assessments of urban heat mitigation strategies, including strategies targeting low-income communities since ~90% of these cities show income-based temperature disparities. All strategies lower daytime ΔAT, with targeted afforestation with (without) albedo management reducing daytime ΔAT for low income groups from 0.56±0.94℃ to 0.22±0.92℃ (0.24±0.93℃) and income-based ΔAT gap from -0.50±0.94℃ to -0.15±91℃ (-0.17±93℃). Our results demonstrate the importance of targeted heat mitigation in low income communities, where residents have less options to adapt to extreme heat.
